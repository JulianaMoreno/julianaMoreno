## Hi there 👋

My name is Juliana Moreno, but call me ju

I'm software engineer - full-stack Developer

Currently working as a **Delivery Lead at Axur**, I manage projects and develop innovative solutions as part of a dynamic and collaborative team, with the mission of making the internet a safer place.

I hold a **Bachelor's degree in Computer Science** from the Federal University of Viçosa and have solid experience in software development across both backend and frontend, using technologies like **Java, Kotlin, JavaScript/Typescript (React.js, Next.js), and Flutter**.

Throughout my career, I’ve worked in both **small companies and large-scale startups**, which has given me a versatile perspective and the ability to adapt to diverse environments.
And, I've contributed to various initiatives across different teams, tackling technical challenges and improving development processes.

A key part of my journey was at **QuintoAndar**, one of Brazil’s leading real estate tech startups, where I spent nearly five years. 
During that time, I built much of the technical foundation I have today—contributing to **cross-functional teams, engaging in impactful projects, and working with a variety of modern stacks, cloud infrastructure, and scalable architectures, with a strong focus on modern frameworks, microservices, and engineering best practices.**

Beyond my technical role, I'm passionate about **leadership and teamwork**.
I've been actively involved in organizations such as **AIESEC** and **Rotaract (Rotary)**, where I developed strong skills in **people management, project coordination**, and **community engagement**.

I'm always eager to learn and grow, and I’m especially interested in collaborating on challenging projects that create a **positive impact** in people's lives.
