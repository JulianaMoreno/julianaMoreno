I’m a **Fullstack Engineer** with a solid backend and frontend background and a passion for building intuitive, scalable, and accessible interfaces.  
Currently transitioning from a leadership role back to hands-on coding, I'm focusing on **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Java**, working on meaningful products with a strong emphasis on code quality and user experience.

🎯 I'm especially interested in **feuustack engineering**, **frontend engineering**, **UI/UX best practices**, and contributing to projects that combine clean code with real-world impact.
